            <p><strong>How I Prepared For Bootcamp</strong></p>

<p>There are so many options when it comes to preparing for a coding bootcamp that it can be quite overwhelming. I know that is how I felt when I first decided to join <a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368/first-impressions-and-goals-going-forward/academy.smashingboxes.com">The Iron Yard Powered by Smashing Boxes</a>. As I searched online and asked other people, more and more conflicting information kept piling up. So, what exactly should one do to prepare for a coding bootcamp? The short answer is that it depends on many factors. </p>

<p>About three months prior to my program start date, I met with a local executive at a mobile application development company to get his perspective on the effectiveness of bootcamps. My major takeaway was that I lacked enough experience with code to truly know if I could commit to such a program. So, he suggested spending 1-2 hours several days a week coding as a test run. He referred me to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368/first-impressions-and-goals-going-forward/codeschool.com">Code School</a>. From there I began working through the courses at a steady pace. (As you can probably guess, I really enjoyed coding. Combining that with a few other experiences, I decided to enroll at TIY.) To date, I have completed the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations">Front End Foundations</a>  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-formations">Front End Formations</a>  </li>
<li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368/first-impressions-and-goals-going-forward/JavaScript%20Road%20Trip%20Part%201">Javascript Road Trip Part I</a>  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2">Javascript Road Trip Part II</a>  </li>
<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3">Javascript Road Trip Part III</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Shortly after finishing up these courses, my <a href="https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/prework.md">Pre-Work</a> from TIY came in. Around this time, I also discovered an excellent blog from a recent TIY Durham Front End Graduate (<a href="http://jordanscodinglife.blogspot.com/?m=1">Jordan's Coding Life</a>). He outlines a very extensive pre-work program for Front End Students. With these two resources in hand, I focused on my provided <a href="https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/prework.md">Pre-Work</a> first, and completed it. Then, I moved on to the few parts of Jordan's list that I could fit in (Treehouse Portfolio Tutorial, A command line article, and the FizzBuzz test). That sums up my pre-work experience.</p>

<p>Based upon my first two days, my guess would be that I am solidly prepared for the course. Had I been stronger in CSS, my first 2 days would have been less stressful. Not to mention, my first project would have been of a much higher quality. We have only dealt with HTML and CSS so far. My answer may change once we reach javascript. So, to anyone going into the Front End Course at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368/first-impressions-and-goals-going-forward/academy.smashingboxes.com">The Iron Yard Powered by Smashing Boxes</a>, I would suggest that you complete the pre-work provided by TIY early enough to deep dive into Jordan's suggestions. Had I been stronger in CSS, my first 2 days would have been less stressful. Not to mention, my first project would have been of a much higher quality. </p>

<p>I have one last suggestion for pre-work. Read as much as you can about the experiences that students have at TIY. You will learn a ton by reading about the obstacles faced and lessons learned by graduates. Here are a few blogs that I have found immensely useful:</p>

<ul>  
<li><a href="http://jordanscodinglife.blogspot.com/?m=1">Jordan's Coding Life</a>  
</li>  
<li><a href="http://blog.atmartin.io/">Constant Growth</a></li>  
<li><a href="https://railsmama.wordpress.com/">Rail's Mama</a></li>  
</ul>

<p>This post has gone on longer than I expected, so I will be brief with my day-to-day goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arrive no later than 8AM (that means in a chair coding at 8AM)  </li>
<li>Leave no later than 8PM (until final projects begin)  </li>
<li>Wake at 6AM daily/Exercise every day  </li>
<li>I will go to bed no later than 11PM  </li>
<li>Pair program or collaborate every day  </li>
<li>Post every project to Github pages/Filter high quality work to my portfolio site  </li>
<li>Update Github/My Portfolio Site with projects weekly  </li>
<li>Update LinkedIn weekly  </li>
<li>Post to this blog once a week</li>
</ol>

<p>In three months we will see how it turns out.</p>
