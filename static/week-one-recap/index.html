            <p>With one week down, I have completed three projects and learned more about programming than I ever have studying on my own. It's a strange feeling to get through week one. I am still feeling that optimism and excitement from getting started. At the same time, the pressure is mounting. The material is definitely being crammed into our brains at lightning speed. Before I ramble too much, here is a quick breakdown of the week:</p>

<h6>General Schedule</h6>  

<p><em>Monday --------> Thursday</em> <br />
Lecture: 9AM-12PM - some days we finish lecture early <br />
Lab: 12PM - till the work is done</p>

<p><em>Friday Free For All</em> <br />
No lecture on these days. We have something called a Huddle @10AM. Each class is split into groups of five to come together with five students from the other courses. This is a great opportunity to understand the material that the Python and Rails courses are covering. This time is also used for more general conversations about succeeding in the program (personal goals, online presence, etc.).</p>

<h6>Takeaways</h6>  

<p>After completing three projects this week (two site redesigns and one memory game), I am starting to get a feel for the process. </p>

<p><em> Approach Conceptually: what does the client/instructor want on the site/who is this site made for?</p>

<p>Design &amp; Wireframe: Get on <a>Dribbble.com</a> for inspiration. Keep it simple and functional. Follow the suggestions in this <a href ="https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda">article</a>, and it's hard to go terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Plan HTML document by labeling your wireframe.</p>

<p>Get to it and build your site.</em></p>

<p>So far this is my process. I'm sure it will change a lot by the end of the program.</p>

<p>Our associate instructor gave some valuable advice this week about keeping our minds open to career opportunities during the program. The more that I think about it, that mindset is a key part of excelling in this program. Every day is a little bit different. We have to change gears constantly and approach problems from new angles when we are stuck. You can't come into this program too uptight or you will snap quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Irritation of the Week</strong> <br />
Fluid grids and animations. Our weekend project was a memory card game. We were asked to keep a consistent aspect ratio for all cards as the window size/shape changed. It required hours of research to get my head around the concepts and more time to implement what I learned.</p>

<p>Here are the resources that helped me do it: <br />
<a>http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids</a> <br />
<a>http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/</a> <br />
<a>http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design</a> <br />
<a>http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/</a> <br />
<a>https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, I was not able to get the cards to flip in my game. I am still working on that animation. I have a few guesses about the problems in my code, but fixing those issues are another story.</p>

<p><strong>Dream Destination of the Week</strong></p>

<p>Twickenham, England</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Twickenham_Stadium_-_May_2012.jpg/800px-Twickenham_Stadium_-_May_2012.jpg" ></p>

<p>I know that England is another obvious travel destination, but I have a suggestion most people would not offer. In high school, my rugby team took a trip to England for spring break to play a few exhibitions against English teams. While staying in Bracknell, England, we took a day trip to Twickenham Stadium. This stadium is home to the English national team. If you have the opportunity to see a rugby match, I highly recommend it. There is nothing quite like seeing a match live in a sold out stadium.</p>
