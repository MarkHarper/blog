        <section class="post-content">
            <p>This week we started javascript. Once our instructor introduced the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">Document Object Model</a> (DOM), it really hit hard. When you approach javascript without dealing with DOM, the process is similar to playing a challenging puzzle: simplify the problem into its smallest elements, build out the functions and bring it all together to an elegant solution. Adding in the user interaction brings on error messages that don't have clear causes or solutions. Going forward, I'm sure that the way to approach these issues will become apparent.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong> <br />
Willpower, yours will be tested. Mine certainly was in week two. The wear and tear of long hours and less than optimal sleep took its toll. I broke on a few occasions, taking some quality time for a Game of Thrones episode and a trip on Stumbleupon.com. I feel as though I did not learn as effectively this week. So, here is a short list to stay on point in coding bootcamp:</p>

<p>-Sleep: Plan on a time to go to bed and stick to the schedule. This sound like a childish thing to do, but it makes staying productive much easier. This is not an easy task. I am overdue on sleep by about two hours as I type right now.</p>

<p>-Deadlines: You may have only one day to finish your homework, but this doesn't mean that you must jump right into the thick of things. Take time to plan out your algorithm and MVP. Then, take more time to think through your solutions and set deadlines for the day. This will help you produce a quality product.</p>

<p>-R &amp; R &amp; Fun: As much as I have emphasized efficiently using one's time to learn coding, a big part of this program is learning in a group. Much of the value provided by a bootcamp comes in the form of your classmates. They are another resource for knowledge, an opportunity to meet new people (aka that networking thing people talk about, but most of all your classmates are a support system. Some days you will breeze through material and help others solve problems without tearing their hair out. Other days, the situation will be reversed. So, get to know your classmates. Leave the classroom for a bit. Go for a walk, a coffee, a drink. Do something with your fellow bootcampers. </p>

<p><strong>Irritation of the Week</strong> <br />
You probably guessed this one. The document object model was something I struggled with for a couple days. With the help of our instructor, my classmates and MDN, I made it out the other side.</p>

<p>Resources: <br />
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">Mozilla Developer Network</a> - This was really the only one I used, other than <a>stackoverflow.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Dream Destination of the Week</strong></p>

<p>-Juneau, Alaska</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Juneau%2C_Alaska.jpg/800px-Juneau%2C_Alaska.jpg"></p>

<p>This selection is not your typical post-college trip, but it is definitely worthy of a mention. I spent over a month in Juneau, Alaska during a high school summer. The raw nature of Alaska never ceased to amaze me. I would love return one day for more exploring. There is no shortage of outdoor activities, whether you're interested in fishing, skiing, hiking, biking, climbing, etc. You name it, they've got it. To add one last thing, fresh Alaskan salmon is absolutely delicious.</p>
