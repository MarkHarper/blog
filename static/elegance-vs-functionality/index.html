            <p>One of the biggest things that attracted me to <a href="http://academy.smashingboxes.com/">TIY Powered by Smashing Boxes</a> was the potential to create an extensive portfolio. The program is structured with nine weeks of lecture and a three week final project. Each lecture week has a large project on the weekend. So, there are many opportunities to build out your portfolio. But with all of those opportunities comes an important question, what should you expect from your projects? Here is a short list of my opinions on the matter:</p>

<ul>

<li>  
<strong><em>Elegance vs. Function -</em></strong>  Does your code have to be perfectly organized or have every function in the nightmare mode of your project? In short, it depends. You don't want to have every function in nightmare mode with code that no one can read or understand. On the other side, you don't want to focus so much on writing organized code that you only finish the simplest of functions. You have to find a balance. Additionally, this program is a process. Your portfolio should reflect that. You want to show that you are finishing more of the assignments by the end of the program and becoming more skilled in the way you use code to solve problems.  
</li>  
<p></p>  
<li>  
<strong><em>It's a portfolio. Make it look impressive! -</em></strong> This mostly applies to my fellow front end students. You are expected to be exceptional with HTML/CSS and have a solid grasp on design principles. I don't mean to imply that your portfolio has to include a bunch of responsive sliders or animations. But your work must demonstrate a certain level of competence at creating a palatable, functional site.  
</li>  
<p></p>  
<li>  
<strong><em>Comparing yourself to others -</em></strong> Don't do it! Stop it! No matter what I say, you will compare yourself to your peers. It is human nature. If you feel like your portfolio is the <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659123-1ED12AEC00000578-707_634x411.jpg">money pit</a> to your friend's <a href="https://bighornforge.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/biltmore.jpeg">Biltmore estate</a>, then remember that the program is a process. I know I keep saying it, but it really is. Employers really value a willingness and ability to learn in junior developers, or so I'm told. If you can show that you went from 0-90 while Mr. Biltmore went from 60-120, then you may be a more attractive candidate. That's an oversimplification, but you get the idea.  
</li>

</ul>
