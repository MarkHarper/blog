            <p>One more week down at TIY and our workflow has changed so much in only seven days. Here is a quick rundown of the tools we added to our arsenal this week:</p>

<ul>  
<li><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone Js</a>So far we have mostly used the routing function</li>  
<li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp Js</a> - a streaming build system that really speeds up the development process.</li>  
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> - I know. It's just a code editor, but any code editor that offers git commands in the UI is worth checking out.</li>  
<li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS/SCSS</a> - Syntactically awesome style sheets!! Gotta love variables and ways to group CSS settings.</li>  
<li><strong>CSS Frameworks</strong> - We had an overview of several options, but a live demo of Twitter's Bootstrap. Here are a few.  
<ul>  
<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>  
<li><a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> - Even without considering the name, it seemed like the most interesting choice to me.</li>  
<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a></li>  
</ul>  

<p></li> <br />
</ul></p>

<p>Wow, that really was a lot. This week really pushed us forward in terms of intelligently structuring our projects and planning ahead. This seems like a great lead in to more work with JS frameworks like <a href="http://localhost:2368/week-three-recap/backbonejs.org">Backone</a> and <a href="http://localhost:2368/week-three-recap/angularjs.org">Angular</a>. Especially because of their focus on the separation of concerns and the planning required in that.</p>

<h5>Takeaways</h5>  

<p>I really only have two takeaways this week. <br />
<strong>-<em>Don't research too much</em> :</strong> In planning my project, I spent a day reading and researching Backbone JS. Ultimately, I only used bits and pieces of what I learned. The wasted time also cost me a lot of valuable time. Don't do what I did. Follow the process. Do some planning/wireframing/diagramming, then proceed to building your project.</p>

<p><strong>-<em>So much to learn, so little time</em> :</strong> I love learning about all of these useful technologies, but I like to feel confident using a tool before I move on to learn something else. But the more time I spend coding, the more I am becoming used to being uncomfortable.</p>

<h5>Irritation of the Week</h5>  

<p>There was no big bad irritation this week. I am becoming acclimated to the struggle with new tools.</p>

<h5>Resources:</h5>  

<ul>  
<li><p><a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/">Backbone Fundamentals</a> - an excellent intro to backbone with example projects to work through</p></li>  
<li><p><a href="https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/">Chartist JS</a> - a javascript library for building stylish and responsive charts. This wasn't part of the class work, but I thought it would be cool to restructure an earlier project's statistics on the Titanic Tragedy with data visualization. </p></li>  
</ul>

<h5>Fascinating Tech News:</h5>  

<ul>  
<li><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/08/swift-open-source/">Swift Open Source</a> - The title says it all. Apple is releasing its iOS language as an open source development project.</p></li>  
</ul>

<p><strong>Dream Destination of the Week</strong></p>

<p>When I outlined this recap, I didn't have any specific place in mind. I simply wrote "somewhere warm and beautiful". In light of that mindset, I am letting google do the choosing this week. And the choice is...</p>

<p><a href="index.html" title=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/View_of_Northern_Saipan.JPG" width="640" height="428" alt=""></a></p>

<p>the Pacific island of Saipan.</p>

<p>Enjoy the trip!! I will be coding away. At least until I finish my program. Maybe a brief trip before the job search will be possible.</p>
