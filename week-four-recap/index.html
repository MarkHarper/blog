        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Here's a quick rundown of what I did this past week. We covered Underscore.js templating and routing with Backbone.js. Also, our instructor, Chris, was kind enough to do a bit of object oriented review. This week was a little different for our homework. Instead of daily assignments, we had a week long assignment, an appointments application, to work on. I was partnered with Brendan, who was a huge help setting up our templates and routing. As an aside, check out his awesome <a href="https://github.com/wholetthedogsout">Github name</a>. Even though we spent 36 hours on one bug, we came out with a solid product. All together it was a very productive week. I am looking forward to going more in depth on backbone.js soon, because routing has not sunk in quite yet.</p>

<h5>Takeaways</h5>  

<p><strong>-<em> Persistence is key</em> :</strong> Bugs are really irritating. Especially when you are first learning a topic. When we struggled for 36-hours to fix a simple template issue, it didn't look like we would ever finish the app. But with a ton of debugging (console.log line by line) and help from our instructor, it came together. Just when you're about to lose your patience, go for a walk and tell yourself "every problem can be solved". With time and enough stubbornness, you will figure it out.</p>

<p><strong>-<em>Learn from the experience of others</em> :</strong> We have had several guest speakers at this point in the program. While their technical advice has been on point, I have to say I am finding their professional anecdotes to be more illuminating. There are hundreds of ways, if not more, for me to learn front end development. However, the resources for learning about the team workflows and hiring practices of tech agencies are much more difficult to come by. When your guest speakers come in, make sure you learn the material that they teach, but don't check out during the Q&amp;A section. You will learn just as much from their career experiences as you will from their technical knowledge.</p>

<h5>Irritation of the Week</h5>  

<p>This is a really easy section this week. That 36-hour bug drove me nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Dream Destination of the Week</strong></p>

<p>Ecuador</p>

<p>In keeping with the South American trend from last week, I chose the Ecuadorian Amazon. My roommate has been taking trips to his Uncle's school in Ecuador for years. I've heard so many great stories about Ecuador that I've got to go at this point.</p>
