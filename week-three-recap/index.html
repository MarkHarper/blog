            <p>This week marked the introduction of Jquery, a javascript library packed with power. Jquery offers concise code that makes working with the DOM more intuitive. Using Jquery to approach our homework was a refreshing experience. It helped simplify my solutions and avoid a lot of frustration. That being said, my week was not without its challenges. Learning the Jquery syntax and understanding its functions caused me a lot of headaches. I will get to that a bit later. </p>

<h5>Takeaways</h5>  

<p><strong>-<em>Github is your portfolio</em> :</strong> If you are in code school, then you are probably hosting some of your portfolio on Github pages. When it is time for you to get a job, your potential employer will see these projects on your Github account. Chances are that each company you contact will peruse your entire Github account. So, it's best to follow a set of best practices to organize your code. You will find resources for Javascript and CSS guidelines listed below. Outside of your code, add a Readme document to each repository that you have on Github. Explain your project in a clear and concise manner. As it stands now, I need to take my own advice. My Github account does not include Readme documents in every repo or perfectly organized code. However, I will be adding Readme documents this weekend, and I suggest that you do the same.</p>

<p><strong>-<em>A brief note on working in groups remotely</em> :</strong> This week was our first experience with pair programming. I had a great collaborator, and I learned a ton about styling thanks to his CSS skills. We worked on a very challenging user signup application, and we got the job done. Feel free to take look at our <a href="http://localhost:2368/week-three-recap/markharper.github.io/user-management">project</a> if you like. Despite being proud of the finished product, the process felt disjointed once I left town. I have to take the blame for this, because I didn't take the initiative to talk about our work schedules. If you are going to work in a group remotely, be direct in your communication, do your best to work at the same time, and set a time each day to check in on each other's progress.</p>

<h5>Irritation of the Week</h5>  

<p>The first day that Jquery was introduced I struggled to complete more than one of several widgets assigned in the homework. At this point in the program I expect the learning process to be challenging. But this was one frustrating day. I think it was so bothersome because I was very comfortable with vanilla Javascript. Then, here comes Jquery, supposedly very helpful and it was a pain on day one. Obviously, I have since come to realize the awesomeness of Jquery. </p>

<p><strong>Dream Destination of the Week</strong></p>

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>

<p>I have always wanted to go on a long trip through South America. Buenos Aires would surely be one of my stops on that trip.</p>
