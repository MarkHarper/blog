            <p>Tomorrow I take the plunge into the the Front End Engineering program at The Iron Yard powered by Smashing Boxes in Durham, NC. Even after speaking with former graduates, current instructors and reading countless articles online, I am still not sure what to expect. I am ready for a rigorous experience and expect there to be a lot of pressure from all the new material piling up. Nonetheless, I can't help but be excited about starting a new career path.</p>

<p>I do feel well prepared for the bootcamp. My prework program included a variety of sources. I completed my instructor's prework assignments in their entirety, but I completed some additional work as well. I will go into more prework detail in an upcoming post. Truth be told, I won't know if I am well prepared until the program is well under way.</p>

<p>Tonight, my cohort met with instructors, TAs, graduates and administrators from The Iron Yard. It was the first time that all of us were in the same space. For the most part none of us had met before. Aside from some wide eyed looks, the occasional awkward eye contact and some clunky introductions everyone fell into place smoothly. I was really impressed that by the end of the night I already felt comfortable within this group of vastly different people. Surprisingly, no one seemed on edge or up tight. Maybe it's just the calm before the storm, but one can hope, right?</p>

<p>Taking a bit from another TIY graduate (<a href="http://jordanscodinglife.blogspot.com/">Lt. Liberty</a>), each post will close with a bit of structure. Coding is full of roadblocks and lessons to be learned. On a completely unrelated note, traveling is one my favorite past times. So, each post will end with some absurdly frustrating code that I have dealt with recently and an amazing destination that I would to visit to calm myself. </p>

<p><strong>Github Pages</strong></p>

<p>Today I tried in vain to setup a portfolio site ahead of this program. Simply, to make building a portfolio a less stressful process as I go along. Oh, the irony. I have fiddled for hours with the command line, Github's website, and mac application to get my portfolio site hosted for free. Unfortunately, I do not have a live webpage yet. I do have a decent looking portfolio site on preview in Atom. With more time and a bit of patience, this is definitely a solvable problem.</p>

<p><strong>Riomaggiore, Italy</strong></p>

<p>I was lucky enough to visit this beautiful seaside town on two occasions and would love to return once again. It is part of a series of towns connected by train and cliffside trails. One of the five towns has a long beach that extends the length of the town. Enjoying world class Italian cuisine on a balcony by the beach is highly recommended. In the meantime, it is time to rest. For tomorrow will be a day full of coding.</p>
